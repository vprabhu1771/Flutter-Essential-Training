Set up your Flutter project and add the necessary dependencies. You will need the http package 
for making API requests and the flutter_bloc package for state management. 
Update your pubspec.yaml file as follows:

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  http: ^0.13.4
  flutter_bloc: ^8.0.1


To install a package in Flutter, you can use the `flutter pub get` command. Here's how you can 
install a package using the command line:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your Flutter project directory using the `cd` command.

3. Run the following command to install the package:

   ```
   flutter pub get
   ```

   This command will fetch and download the package specified in your `pubspec.yaml` file and 
its dependencies.

4. Once the command completes successfully, the package and its dependencies will be installed 
in your Flutter project.

Remember to specify the package you want to install in your `pubspec.yaml` file under the 
`dependencies` section before running `flutter pub get`. After installing a new package or 
updating existing packages, you may need to restart your IDE or rebuild your Flutter app to 
use the newly installed package.
