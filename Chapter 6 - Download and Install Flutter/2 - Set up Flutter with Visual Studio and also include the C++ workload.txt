To set up Flutter with Visual Studio and include the C++ workload, follow these steps:

1. Install Visual Studio: 
   - Download and install Visual Studio from the official Microsoft website: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/.
   - Make sure to select the "Desktop development with C++" workload during the installation process. This will install the necessary components for C++ development.

2. Install Flutter SDK:
   - Download the Flutter SDK from the official Flutter website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install.
   - Extract the downloaded SDK to a desired location on your computer.

3. Set up Flutter environment variables:
   - Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables" and open the "Edit the system environment variables" option.
   - Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
   - Under the "System variables" section, click on "New" to add a new variable.
   - Set the variable name as "FLUTTER_HOME" and the variable value as the path to the Flutter SDK directory.
   - Locate the "Path" variable, select it, and click on "Edit".
   - Add a new entry with the value "%FLUTTER_HOME%\bin".

4. Install the Flutter and Dart extensions in Visual Studio:
   - Launch Visual Studio.
   - Open the Extensions view by clicking on "Extensions" in the side toolbar or by pressing "Ctrl+Shift+X".
   - Search for "Flutter" in the Extensions view and install the official Flutter extension by Dart Code.
   - Similarly, search for "Dart" in the Extensions view and install the official Dart extension by Dart Code.

5. Configure Flutter SDK in Visual Studio:
   - Open Visual Studio and go to the "View" menu.
   - Select "Command Palette" or press "Ctrl+Shift+P".
   - Type "Flutter: New Application Project" and select it from the list.
   - Choose a location for your Flutter project and provide a name for it.
   - Once the project is created, open the project folder in Visual Studio.

6. Build the Flutter project:
   - Open the terminal in Visual Studio by going to the "View" menu and selecting "Terminal" or by pressing "Ctrl+`".
   - Run the following command in the terminal to fetch the dependencies for your Flutter project:
     ```
     flutter pub get
     ```
   - After the dependencies are fetched, you can build and run the Flutter project using the following command:
     ```
     flutter run
     ```

Now you have successfully set up Flutter with Visual Studio and included the C++ workload. You can start developing Flutter apps with C++ integration using Visual Studio as your IDE.
