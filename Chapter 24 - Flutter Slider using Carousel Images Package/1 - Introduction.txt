To include assets in your Flutter project, you typically specify them in the `pubspec.yaml` file. Here's an example of how you can include the assets you mentioned:

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file in the root of your Flutter project.

2. Update the `flutter` section to include the assets. Add or modify the `assets` field with the path to your images:

   ```yaml
   flutter:
     assets:
       - assets/carousel/1.jpg
       - assets/carousel/2.jpg
       - assets/carousel/3.jpg
       - assets/carousel/4.jpg
   ```

   Ensure that the indentation is correct, as YAML is sensitive to indentation.

3. Save the `pubspec.yaml` file.

4. Run the following command in your terminal to get the assets:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

This informs Flutter to include these assets in the build. Now, you can reference these assets in your Flutter code. For example, if you have an image widget:

```dart
Image.asset('assets/carousel/1.jpg')
```

Make sure to use the correct path when referencing the assets in your code.

After making these changes, you should be able to access and use these assets in your Flutter project.
