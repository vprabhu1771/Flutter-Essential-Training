Add your Flutter Launcher Icons configuration to your pubspec.yaml or create a new config file called flutter_launcher_icons.yaml. An example is shown below. More complex examples can be found in the example projects.

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_launcher_icons: "^0.13.1"

flutter_launcher_icons:
  android: "launcher_icon"
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/icon/icon.png"
  min_sdk_android: 21 # android min sdk min:16, default 21
  web:
    generate: true
    image_path: "path/to/image.png"
    background_color: "#hexcode"
    theme_color: "#hexcode"
  windows:
    generate: true
    image_path: "path/to/image.png"
    icon_size: 48 # min:48, max:256, default: 48
  macos:
    generate: true
    image_path: "path/to/image.png"



Run the package

After setting up the configuration, all that is left to do is run the package.

flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
