To install the Android SDK Command-Line Tools on Windows 10, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the official Android Studio website: [https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html).

2. Scroll down to the "Command line tools only" section and click on the "Download" link corresponding to your operating system (Windows).

3. Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded ZIP file and extract its contents to a directory of your choice. For example, you can create a folder called `Android` in your `C:` drive and extract the contents there.

4. Open File Explorer and navigate to the directory where you extracted the contents of the ZIP file.

5. Inside the extracted folder, locate the `tools` folder and open it.

6. While holding the Shift key, right-click on an empty area inside the `tools` folder, and then select "Open command window here" or "Open PowerShell window here." This will open a command prompt or PowerShell window with the current directory set to the `tools` folder.

7. In the command prompt or PowerShell window, type the following command to start the Android SDK Manager:

   ```
   sdkmanager.bat
   ```

   This will initiate the installation of the Android SDK packages. If you encounter a message about updating the SDK tools, you can choose to update them by entering `y` and pressing Enter.

8. The SDK Manager will display a list of available packages. You can install specific packages by typing their corresponding numbers and pressing Enter. For example, if you want to install the latest Android SDK Platform, type `1` and press Enter. Follow the prompts to accept the licenses and complete the installation.

9. Once the installation is complete, you can close the SDK Manager.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed the Android SDK Command-Line Tools on Windows 10. You can now use the tools for various development tasks, such as building and debugging Android applications from the command line.
